# Module 18 Challenge - Cryptocurrencies

The objective of this project is to analyze a dataset, which contains details about the available cryptocurrencies, how much they are being traded, and the available coins. By analyzing these data, we will be able to provide recommendations to our customer about which cryptocurrencies are a good option for investment.
